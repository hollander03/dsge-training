# DSGE Training
 Repository for training material and capacity building on Modern Macroeconomic Theory and Computational Methods for Macroeconomics

## Training resources
- Repository for training material and capacity building on Modern Macroeconomic Theory and Computational Methods for Macroeconomics are in the `training` folder: [training](https://github.com/hollander03/dsge-training/tree/main/training).
- `user_guide` contains a practitioner's guide to using the NT-DSGE model: [user guide](https://github.com/hollander03/dsge-training/tree/main/ntdsge/0.user_guide). It provides the necessary information to use the NT-DSGE model for policy analysis and to develop the skills to maintain and improve it. The practitioner should have a basic understanding of DSGE models and should be familiar with MATLAB before attempting to use the model. Supplementary training resources are available in the `training` subdirectory, which takes you to the repository for training material and capacity building that was used for the Modelling & Forecasting Unit in the Economic Policy Division at National Treasury. It includes a short MATLAB primer.

## Model codes
- Repository containing resources and replication files for DSGE models are in the `ntdsge` folder: [ntdsge](https://github.com/hollander03/dsge-training/tree/main/ntdsge).
- *Note:* this folder has mostly been emptied for the UNU-WIDER DSGE training workshop for 03 - 07 December 2024.
