[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (Y_bar, i_bar) when using steady. If these
parameters are not initialized in a steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may
not be able to solve the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and
perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.]
