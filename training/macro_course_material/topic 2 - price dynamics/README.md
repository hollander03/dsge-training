# Topic 2: Nominal Rigidities and Price Dynamics

## Readings

Romer, Chapter 6

- This is again an extensive chapter that gives a very wide coverage of many theoretical and some empirical aspects of nominal rigidity. We will only focus on a small part for the technical development of our model, but the chapter provides a great source for a building a deep base in these issues.

-- Part A provides a rather eclectic set of different models with either fully rigid prices or wages. In the past I have covered these, but found they are too disparate for proper intuition building. As such I leave it to you for enrichments. Section 6.4 is particularly useful, but we will return to this in a later lecture.

-- Part B, section 6.5 forms the core of the model building in this lecture

-- The rest of the text is again too varied and dense for us to consider in detail, although I will briefly allude to section 6.9 which gives Lucas's excellent intuitive structure on why/when inflation matters, and under what (model) conditions policy can improve on market outcomes. 

*Both prescribed papers are examples of how the core assumptions in the model we are building are formally tested against the empirical data. These are examinable in the sense that the broad conclusions of the papers and how they relate to our base model may form part of an essay question.*

- In all models where nominal disturbances have real effects, price adjustment must in some way be imperfect. Prices must be sticky. The authors show that it is risky/incomplete to consider only aggregate prices, or average price series to evaluate whether prices are in fact sticky empirically. They use detailed micro data to study this question and show important features such as temporary sales, product-churning, cross-sectional heterogeneity and large idiosyncratic price movements are critical for understanding aggregate price sluggishness and how the economy responds to demand shocks

- Even if we are happy to accept that prices are sticky enough to yield real effects of nominal disturbances, the question remains if sticky prices are sub-optimal. Some models yield optimally sticky prices, which implies that policy cannot improve on welfare, even when it has real effects. The authors show, using stock-market evidence, that there is a welfare cost: firms with stickier prices experience more stock market volatility.
