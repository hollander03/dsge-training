# Topic 1: Real Business Cycle Models

## Romer Chapter 5

- Note that this is an extensive chapter with many technical variations. Romer uses somewhat different structure and notation to focus on the analytical solution to such models. We will use a slightly different model and notation to match that of the next two lectures more directly. Read the chapter with an overview in mind, to learn about the history and motivation of the models as well as the various variations in real (as opposed to nominal) features of the basic Walrasian real business cycle approach.
 
[Kehoe, Midrigan and Pastorino 2018 Evolution of modern business cycle models: accounting for the Great Recession](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedmsr/566.html)

- This is a very nice overview of the development of these models and how new adjustments manage to account for significant features of the Great Recession that followed the global financial crisis of 2008. Again, read with attention to get a feel of how these models are motivated and analyzed. Focus on what the researchers want to achieve and how and to what extent each assumption changes the results in the required direction. This will be useful to build your intuition on how these models are conceived and updated with new features.
