Repository for training material and capacity building on Modern Macroeconomic Theory and Computational Methods for Macroeconomics

## Overview
- Session blocks under [`Schedule`](#schedule) indicate Sections by bullet numbering. 1 Session = 2 Hours. 
- Additional Q&A sessions scheduled to ensure everyone is on track.
- We will aim to follow a [Socratic approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) to the training so that we can have you all engage. 
- Prescribed resources should therefore be familiarized with before contact sessions --- i.e., watch tutorial videos and read through prescribed slides & notes so that we focus on challenges and practical aspects.
- So look to prepare questions on what you struggled with, the insights/revelations that you experienced, and the critiques that you may have on the underlying assumptions/presuppositions.
- It would be ideal for the **NT-DSGE Team** to post these remarks on the [National Treasure Slack Channel](https://national-treasure.slack.com) *before each contact session*.
- If the content is not all covered within the designated session, the **NT-DSGE Team** should post questions on the [National Treasure Slack Channel](https://national-treasure.slack.com) *before the following contact session*.
- We will look to split Q&A sessions into 1 hour recap and engagement (Q&A), and 1-hour hands on (e.g., run the code, interpret, adjust). 

## Resources
- Our sessions will follow closely to the [DYNARE TUTORIALS by Willi Mutschler](https://mutschler.eu/dynare/)
- With supplementary material on [MACROECONOMIC THEORY by Sang Seok Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/ssleeeconomist/teaching/506?authuser=0)
- This [HANDBOOK OF MACROECONOMICS (CHAPTER 9)](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/FVRS_Handbook.pdf) provides an overview of solution and estimation techniques for DSGE models. The authors cover the foundations of numerical approximation techniques as well as statistical inference and they survey the latest developments in the field. It is a challenging text and thus your benchmark to aim for.
- See also the `readers` folder (there is a huge amount of literature, so we've tried to be as focused as possible on the DSGE and empirical topics identified). We will add more to supplement the above core resources.
