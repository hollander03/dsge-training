# DSGE - Training

[`Overview`](#overview) | [`Resources`](#resources) | [`Schedule`](#schedule) | [`Tutorials`](#tutorials) |

Repository for training material and capacity building on Modern Macroeconomic Theory and Computational Methods for Macroeconomics. 

The user guide can be found in the [`ntdsge/0.user_guide`](https://github.com/hollander03/dsge-training/tree/main/ntdsge/0.user_guide) sub-directory. This folder contains the user guide, the Dynare Manual, and additional resources to understand and implement DSGE models in Dynare. The most up-to-date user guide verison will be maintained in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mAzQPIP47KYYNsGOvcBHuVgZHptjEdJH/edit). Please check before downloading. Anyone with the link can comment.

## Overview
- Session blocks under [`Schedule`](#schedule) indicate Sections by bullet numbering. 1 Session = 2 Hours. 
- Additional practical/Q&A sessions scheduled to ensure everyone is on track.
- We will aim to include as much practical training so that we can have you all engage. 
- Prescribed resources should therefore be familiarised with before contact sessions --- i.e., watch tutorial videos and read through prescribed slides & notes so that we focus on challenges and practical aspects.
- So look to prepare questions on what you struggled with, the insights/revelations that you experienced, and the critiques that you may have on the underlying assumptions/presuppositions.
- It may be useful for the **participants** to post these remarks online via a [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/) (the `National Treasure` workspace in Slack).
- If the content is not all covered within the designated session, the **participants** should post questions on the [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/) *before the following contact session*.
- We will look to split Q&A sessions into 1 hour of recap and engagement (Q&A), and 1 hour of practical work (e.g., run the code, interpret, adjust). 

## Resources
- Our sessions will follow closely to the [DYNARE TUTORIALS by Willi Mutschler](https://mutschler.eu/dynare/)
- The NT-DSGE team is also developing additional **fiscal-policy-focused** training exercises based on Ljungqvist & Sargent in a seperate repo [Practicing-Dynare-NT](https://github.com/hollander03/Practicing-Dynare-NT)
- See also supplementary material on [MACROECONOMIC THEORY by Sang Seok Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/ssleeeconomist/teaching/506?authuser=0)
- This [HANDBOOK OF MACROECONOMICS (CHAPTER 9)](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/FVRS_Handbook.pdf) provides an overview of solution and estimation techniques for DSGE models. The authors cover the foundations of numerical approximation techniques as well as statistical inference and they survey the latest developments in the field. It is a challenging text and thus your benchmark to aim for.
- See also the `readers` folder (there is a huge amount of literature, so we've tried to be as focused as possible on the DSGE and empirical topics identified). We will add more to supplement the above core resources.
