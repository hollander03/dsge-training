**PART 1: ECONOMIC GROWTH** | **PART 2: BUSINESS CYCLES**

## Context and Outcomes

Modern macroeconomics is an exciting field which is currently changing very rapidly: the international financial crisis starting in 2008 has highlighted many practical and theoretical problems and questioned the received macroeconomic wisdom in several respects. The covid pandemic has elicited fiscal responses unprecedented in recent history, and wreaked havoc on the global economy. In this course we will explore the tools of mainstream macroeconomics and consider their strengths and weaknesses in providing analyses of these matters.

This course considers the principal approaches used in modern macroeconomics to investigate business cycles and the long-term performance of market economies. In the first part of the course, we study some of the main models of modern macroeconomics (Neoclassical, Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans and Overlapping-Generations models) in the context of growth theory. We also use the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans and Overlapping-Generations models in application lectures, where we apply these models to topical questions such as how governments finance their spending.

In the second part of the course, we study the business cycle from the perspective of models with nominal rigidities, working towards the New Keynesian Phillips curve and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models which forms the core of a large number of modern macroeconomic policy models. This is followed by a session on models of investment and consumption (asset pricing), and finally one on credit cycles and financial crises.

By the end of the course, the student will have the skillset to understand and critique a substantial body of modern macroeconomics research, develop the writing ability necessary to communicate macroeconomic results and be prepared for further advanced courses in dynamic macroeconomics.
