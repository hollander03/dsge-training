# DSGE User Guide

This folder contains the user guide, the Dynare Manual, and additional resources to understand and implement DSGE models in Dynare. The most up-to-date user guide verison will be maintained in this (google doc)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mAzQPIP47KYYNsGOvcBHuVgZHptjEdJH/edit]. Please check before downloading. Anyone with the link can comment.

*Note:* beginners for DSGE training can skip to page 5 of the user guide where the document begins with instructions on how to install the DYNARE software. You can alternatively start reading the Dynare Manual (this is more comprehensive).

The `other` folder contains:
- A MATLAB primer
- A primer on linearization.
- A practical tutorial (akin to the one in the training resources).
- A description of Dynare's graph outputs
- A guide to deal with observation equations for estimation
- A guide on installing and configuring Dynare for Octave (a free MATLAB-alternative)
