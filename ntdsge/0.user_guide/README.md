# DSGE User Guide

This folder contains the user guide, the Dynare Manual, and additional resources to understand and implement DSGE models in Dynare.

*Note:* participants of the SA-TIED DSGE workshop 02 - 06 December can skip to page 5 of the user guide where the document begins with instructions on how to install the DYNARE software. You can alternatively start reading the Dynare Manual (this is more comprehensive).

The other folder contains:
- A MATLAB primer
- A primer on linearization.
- A practical tutorial (akin to the one in the training resources).
- A description of Dynare's graph outputs
- A guide to deal with observation equations for estimation
- A stylised flow diagram of the model (incomplete)
