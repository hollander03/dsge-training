# To-Dos:

You will work with the simulation code first (i.e., the code that doesn't estimate the model. So note that there will be some minor differences when you compare to original and updated versions).

## First objective

- (1) Check code corresponds with paper. Label code to correspond with paper equation numbers in Appendix.
- (2) Note the differences to Harri's original code: equations, calibrations, observed variables.
- (3) Complete latex short names and long names for parameters and variables; check latex output of equations and tables.

## Second objective

- (4) Produce a simplified version of the model. Shut off open economy nominal rigidities, exports and imports, foreign block.
- (5) Add a flexible price equilibrium to this model. The aim here is to produce a simpler model to work with potential alternatives and for forecasting. We will also compare the results to the larger model (which doesn't have a flex price equilibrium yet).

## Deligation

- Someone on team to get data for estimation, and automate. Keep track of sources for raw data and the transformations from raw data into final format. Note the effective tax rate calculations. Hylton to upload excel spreadsheet for comparison.
